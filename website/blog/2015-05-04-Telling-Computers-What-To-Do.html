One of my favorite taglines or sayings is "I tell computers what to do for a
living", and "Computers do what you tell them".  Most non-technical folks find
these sayings funny or quaint, but they mean something very specific and
important.  When a user says "the computer deleted my file!" there are only two
thinsgs they can mean: "I told my computer to delete my file" or "someone else
told my computer to delete my file".  Saying "Computers do what you tell them"
is reminding even the most technical people that computers are (with very few
exceptions) deterministic, predictable, and reliable.  Which means when they
don't do what you expect, it's probably your own fault.
</p><p>
Of course, the point isn't to provide apologetics for why today, after 60+
years of the field of computer science existing, it is still so very hard to
get computers to do what you want.  In fact, in many ways it is harder than
ever before.  This is about a deep truth about how computers work.  When a
junior engineer says "It won't do X" or "I can't make it do X" what they mean
is "something is going on that I don't understand" - but you CAN understand it
if you can figure out what questions to ask, and how to ask them.  You don't
have to ask your boss or your mentor or your technical support line - you can
ask your computer.  Presumably, it knows.
</p><p>
Much like "wrong answers" on an essay question in English class, there are
uncountably many ways a computer might break your expectations and fail to do
what you think it should.  But almost all of these, in retrospect, seem
obvious.  Once you know that "one little thing", correcting the problem is
easy.  But how do you find out the "one little thing"?  That is what separates
the good engineers from the great ones, and what contributes to those few who
are 10x or 100x engineers.
</p><p>
In the olden times, everything about a computer was laid bare, and your typical
computer operator could describe the state of every register and exactly what
the computer was doing.  You couldn't do much without this deep level of
understanding.  Today, things are not like that.  I don't know how a BIOS
works.  I'm not sure what happens when I press the power button on my laptop
and the electronics whir to life to complete their sisyphean task of delivering
me pictures of cats falling into water and looking pretty unhappy about it, but
I am grateful that it works.  Somehow, all the registers go from random states
of not having enough electrons, to an appropriate, deterministic state where the
completely non-physical emergent phenomenon we call an "operating system" can
emerge from the chaos.  I also don't know how my operating system works, but
since I use Linux, which is open-source, at least I can *look* at the code and
try to figure it out.  "One of these days..." I always say.
</p><p>
Oh, but there is more!  Because the operating system runs a host of tools in
"userspace", which are not really part of it but without which a computer can't
really do any of those critical cat-related things we talked about earlier.
Again, for me at least, I can view all of the source of how they accomplish
that - but I don't.   I also don't know how my networking stack works.  I'm not
sure how my hard disk writes magnetic 1s and 0s to the platter, complete with
error correction.  I'm not quite sure how my video card tells my monitor which
of the 1960x1280 pixels to turn on and what colors to show for each one, 60
times per second - but it does.  Somehow.  This is why people personify
computers.  This is why people think "they" do "things" to "us".  You can no
more understand everything about your computer than you can know the state of
every neuron in your own brain (how would that work?  Think about it).  
</p><p>
So, back to the 10x engineer.  How do they always seem to know?  How do they
run circles around the rest of us, and just <b>get so much done</b>?  They ask
the right questions, and they ask it of the right entity - their computer.
They (often) don't settle on shoving random print statements into code - they
lay the entire thing bare with a debugger.  They read <b>and understand</b>
every line of code between the moment they press "enter", and the moment the
computer "does something wrong".  And I think they do this because they
understand that "computers do what you tell them".  Whatever is wrong, it has
to be in there somewhere.  I mean, short of a bad motherboard or some spotty
ram.  And good engineers think about that too.  I knew one who, after losing an
<b>entire week</b> debugging non-deterministic behavior, only to find the ram
in his new machine was faulty, swore that he would run memtest86 on every new
machine he bought or got from work annually, for all time.  For the price of a
few hours of burnin when he wouldn't have been using it anyways, he can save
himself countless hours of wondering if he is, in fact, taking crazy pills (a
detrimental state to find oneself in for certain).
</p><p>
So what is my advice to those who would tell computers what to do for a living?
The next time the computer doesn't seem to be listening, maybe you should be
the one who is listening, and asking the right questions.  Have you read the
logs?  What versions of the software are you using?  What has changed since it
worked last?  Can you examine the source code?  Can you examine the state of
the memory?  Does it fail deterministically?  If not, can you detect a pattern
in the failure?  Maybe you need to invest some serious time to answer some of
these questions.  Maybe you need to write a debugger or disassembler.  Maybe
you even need to go learn assembly, or Java bytecode.  Your boss should be
happy to "pay" you for your time in these endeavours, because the time you
spend today writing these tools or learning how these tools work, instead of
"jiggling it until it works", is paid back to your and your employer tenfold,
or even a hundred fold, and those are dividends worth having.
