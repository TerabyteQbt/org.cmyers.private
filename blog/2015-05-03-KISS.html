		  <p>
		  One of the most often-broken engineering principles is "KISS" - "Keep
		  It Simple, Stupid".  Engineers love to use cool technologies to build
		  cool solutions that are complex, elegant, and "future-proof".  The
		  problem is, of course, the actual situation frequently just doesn't call for anything that fancy.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  That is why I am writing this blog as simple, static HTML.  Dynamic
		  blog solutions, like <a href="http://wordpress.com">wordpress</a>,
		  suffer from exploits and security holes.  Managing them is a pain.
		  Other solutions like <a href="https://github.com/jgm/gitit">gitit</a>
		  (a git-backed wiki I use for various things) don't look very nice
		  (and as a person who tells computers what to do for a living, I had
		  better at least have a passable web site that doesn't look like it
		  transparently proxies the wayback machine).  Twitter bootstrap made
		  making a nice looking website easy, but because everything is static,
		  I can't easily display my blog entries.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  Some day, I may reinvestigate this decision, but for now, let's keep
		  it simple.  When I go to write a new blog entry, I simply copy my
		  template file, and start writing.  When I am ready to publish the
		  entry, I simply add it to the table of blog entries on the main blog
		  page.  Since my entire website itself is hosted on github and
		  automatically deployed via crontab, all I have to do is push my
		  changes to a git repo and the rest happens automagically (just like
		  if I used gitit).  For now, this is the right balance of "simple" and
		  "features".
