        <h1>About Carl Myers </h1>
        <p>Carl Myers studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue
        University in West Lafayette, Indiana.  Carl then spent three years at
        Amazon.com working on various infrastructure teams including Builder
        Tools (The Brazil Build System) and third-party support.  Next Carl
        worked on the Internal Tools team at Palantir Technologies, Inc. where
        he owned source control, continuous build, dependency management, and
        the developer ecosystem as they grew from just under 200 people to over
        a thousand.  Subsequently,  Carl worked for PernixData, a younger
        startup, and spent a year there building out internal tools.  In 2016,
        Carl began work at Cloudera, again working on internal tools generally
        and build systems specifically.</p>
        <p>Carl's vision for internal tools has always been to produce an
        ecosystem so pleasant and productive that it alone would be enough to
        make sure nobody ever wants to leave the company.  Carl's greater vision
        for the field of software development is to bring that same ease of
        development to software engineers everywhere.  Dependencies are a huge
        problem and our industry is still young and still hasn't figured out how
        to solve it.  The key to solid dependencies is maintaining a consistent
        set of reproducible versions which are tested and known to work, and
        modifying that set of versions atomically, only after validating that
        the new set with changes also works.  By having aggressive automation of
        testing, developers can have tools that let them reason strongly about
        their codebase and the changes they are making.</p>
