Company culture is a tricky thing.  Everyone has an opinion about it, and
companies spend millions, sometimes billions of dollars trying to reinforce
their culture because they believe it can be the difference between success and
failure.  Few places are culture as important as in software engineering.  The
sort of collaboration involved in individuals working on teams, and teams
working together, to produce massive scale software is impacted greatly by
culture.  I've been thinking about how this relates to internal tools for a
long time and I've come to believe that tools are one of those most important
and most often-overlooked contributor to developer culture at a software
company.
</p><p>
When I think about tools and build culture, I divide companies into two groups,
"the Google way" and "the Amazon way".  I'm not saying either way is better
than the other (though I prefer the Amazon way), they are just different.
Also, of course, these are not binary but rather fall on a spectrum.  What I
mean by "the Google way" is "everyone has to use the same tools" and "everyone
builds everything from tip all the time".  Team A makes a new version, and the
next time team B builds something that depends upon that project they get Team
A's new changes - whether they want to or not.  Whether it works or not.  They
immediately know if there is a problem - and if things break, they fix it.
Because someone said so.  Because you have to.  Because process.
</p><p>
On the other hand, you have "the Amazon way".  There is a huge shared dev
ecosystem, but they can't *really* force teams to use it.  More importantly,
that dev ecosystem supports building on fixed versions.  This means that if
Team A makes a change, and Team B depends upon Team A's software project, and
that change would break Team A, the build system tells them so, and prevents
them from breaking.  Maybe the impetus falls on Team B to "eventually upgrade
to the newest code and fix the break", or maybe Team A is responsible for
driving the deprecation of old versions of their software within the company.
But neither team is <b>blocked</b>.  Never.  Being blocked is unacceptable and
the build system goes to extreme lengths to ensure that nobody is ever blocked
- not really - they always have the information to know what their change
breaks, and the power to fix it or work around it.  Whether that's a good idea
or not.  Because tools give you power.  And with great power, comes great
complexity.  I mean, responsibility too, but mostly complexity.  <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Ben#.22With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility.22">Uncle
Ben got it half right</a>.
</p><p>
I've witnessed people argue fervently for both sides of the coin, usually using
the best argument for any such system: "It's the worst way to do it except
every other way".  But what I actually think should determine which way a
company goes is the company structure and culture itself.  Does your company
value independence, ownership, and pushing decision making as low in the
(possibly barely existent) hierarchy as possible?  Then you want "the Amazon
way".  Does your company value high-level decision making by the folks that
have the most data?  Are team interactions metered via a comprehensive
hierarchy?  Are tools simple and bureaucracy thick?  Then you probably want
"the Google way".
</p><p>
Again, while I am obviously biased, I've never worked for Google (or any
company that does it "the Google way"), so take that part with a grain of salt
for sure.  Another reason why I personally prefer "the Amazon way", however, is
that it is also the open source way.  There *is* no hierarchy in Open Source -
projects do own their own software, and depend upon each other, and have to
work together somehow.  That necessitates not always building everything using
the same version of every library.  But it also creates the very complex
problem of diamond dependencies, compatibility, and consistency, which are
still unsolved outside the walls of enterprise (and very few apart from Amazon
have solved it inside those walls, either).
</p><p>
So what does open source do?  Is anything close?  It looks to me like the Go
development ecosystem is very close to "the Google way" (unsurprisingly, since
Go was basically birthed whole cloth from the Google womb).  When you build Go
software it finds (via heuristics) all of the libraries' source itself and
builds their newest versions.  Some have tried to invent "the Amazon way" in Go
using a dependency manager called <a
href="https://github.com/tools/godep">godep</a>, but like most solutions it
solves the problem for a specific project, but not the larger ecosystem.  Two
projects using two different sets of dependencies via godep might never be able
to depend upon each other successfully.  Still, the way godep works is
brilliant and probably the best I've seen in open source (for now!  More to
come on this front!)
</p><p>
At the end of the day, all companies have the same goals.  They want to create
value and solve problems.  They do this by attracting the best talent and
keeping them happy.  That means a fun, productive working environment.  Both
sides of the spectrum can contribute to that, but in different ways.  In some
ways, a better name for this conversation might be "A Tale of Two Cultures",
because the arguments for one choice over the other aren't as much about
technical aspects as they are social and cultural ones.  You have to think "How
do I want to organize my teams?" and "How do I want to be organized?".
