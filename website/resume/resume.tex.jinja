\section{EXPERIENCE}
{\bf Indeed, Inc.} -- Austin, TX and Remote
\\
\textit{Staff Software Engineer, SMB Platform} \hfill {\bf January 2020 -- Present}
\\
\begin{itemize}
\item
Worked across the SMB organization to move projects onto a platform for
isolating testing environments which reduced failures due to testing
dependencies in the shared QA environment and also ran significantly faster
than the previous way of doing that in some cases.  Daily work included jumping
into a new codebase and coming up to speed frequently, and working with many
different teams at once.
\item
Helped drive company-wide effort to move projects to push-on-green.  Succeeded
in meeting OKRs by driving rate of push-on-green deployed tickets from 40\% to
90\%.
\item
Planned and executed project to enable a large legacy backend service to use
push-on-green, which required measuring and improving test coverage, enabling
use of hermetic integration testing via an in-house tool built on top of
Kubernetes, streamlining the deployment pipeline, and overcoming both social
and technical hurdles.
{% if LONG_RESUME -%}
\item
Wrote and delivered a git merge driver to automatically resolve conflicts in
build.lock files, reducing developer frustration and preventing people from
avoiding static dependencies.
\item
Wrote and delivered a test running framework to run tests continuously, collect
output and artifacts, and analyze them in order to measure pass rates, flake
rates, and reliability.
\item
Participated in regular weekly Software Development Lifecycle Guild meetings
where I contributed to long term planning for Indeed's developer workflow and
tool ecosystem.
\item
Assisted in training and mentoring by contributing to some documentation and
presentations around the push-on-green effort.  Was the sole contributor in
other training like the Test Reliability Playbook and related efforts to
improve test reliaiblity across SMB and the company as a whole.
{%- endif -%}
\end{itemize}

{\bf Cloudera, Inc.} -- Palo Alto, CA and Austin, TX
\\
\textit{Build and Release Engineer (IC4)} \hfill {\bf May 2016 -- January 2020}
\\
\begin{itemize}
\item
Solely responsible for writing, testing, and deploying several features for the
Automated Review Tool (ART) which launched tiered test runs for developer
submitted code reviews.
{% if LONG_RESUME -%}
ART ensures a successful build for each proposed change, and upon completion runs increasingly comprehensive tiers of
test execution.
{%- endif -%}
ART is a Python Flask application.
\item
In support of a migration to a Docker based build system, rewrote build and test code to deliver more reliable and
developer friendly builds.
{%- if LONG_RESUME %}
The end result achieved cost savings and decreased
maintenance burden.  Backported system to legacy branches as well.  The
polyglot stack included Python, Java, C++, and others in the Hadoop ecosystem.
{%- endif %}
\item
Migrated 30+ independent component teams to a new
commit workflow and implemented new build and test code wherever necessary.
Significantly improved build stability and reduced developer roadblocks due
to broken builds.
{%- if LONG_RESUME %}
Before merging changes, this new system vetted all developer commits by
running unit tests, an additional full stack build, and later tiered
integration test runs, to supplement code reviews.
{%- endif %}
{% if LONG_RESUME %}
\item
Designed, wrote, tested, and delivered a validation tool to confirm artifacts released to public website match expectations.
{% endif %}
\item
Regarded as company-wide Git expert and defacto owner of all Git services.
{%- if LONG_RESUME %}
Responsibilities included configuring and maintaining multiple instances of
Gerrit, including replication between Gerrit instances and GitHub, supporting
issues like repository corruption and authentication issues, and consulting on
Git best practices such as repository partitioning and layout, branching
strategies, etc.
{%- endif %}
{% if LONG_RESUME %}
\item
As part of the on-call rotation, supported all developer workflows and product branching/releases by resolving hundreds of tickets impacting individuals across the company.
{% endif %}
